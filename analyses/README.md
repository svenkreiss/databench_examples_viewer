Databench is a tool that connects a Python analysis to a custom html
frontend. Below are simple live demos. Some more advanced examples
like asynchonously subscribing to a Redis channel and parallel processing
with Redis Queue cannot be shown here but are available in the GitHub
repository
[svenkreiss/databench_examples](https://github.com/svenkreiss/databench_examples).
